# canadamaps

## TODOs

Run script 01 in data_processing, then

- [ ] determine if the economic zones map can be obtained as "sums" of the census zones map
- [ ] determine if the federal_electoral districts map can be obtained as "sums" of the census zones map

## the idea

the idea is to avoid "duplications", for example instead of adding a provinces map, we do:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(canadamaps)

provinces <- get_provinces()

ggplot(data = provinces) + geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry))
```

let's see what creates the provinces map:

```{r}
ggplot(data = census_divisions) + geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry))
```
